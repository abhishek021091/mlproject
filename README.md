## Math Score Prediction Project

# Overview
This project predicts students' math scores using their language, writing scores, and background information. The goal is to understand the relationship between different academic performances and use it for predictive analysis.

# Key Features
- Predicts math scores based on input features.
- Utilizes a machine learning model for prediction.
- Provides insights into factors affecting math performance.

# Technologies Used
- Scikit-Learn: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: For numerical computations.

# Installation
1. Clone the repository:
